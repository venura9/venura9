### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Me

I like to call my self a `Leader` in the space of Cloud and Automation, with the passion to drive technology teams to be successful end-to-end.

Over the years I've been exposed to different stages of the system/software lifecycle with experience across Development, DevOps, Product Management, Operations, Architecture and Practice building. This enables me to operate at rapid phase to get things done, on time, with quality. 

I believe in harnessing the true potential of hyperscale clouds by being closer to native services and not by implementing "multi-cloud" strategies.
